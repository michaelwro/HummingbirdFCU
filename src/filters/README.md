# HUMMINGBIRD FCU DISCRETE FILTERS

**Code By:** Michael Wrona

## `low_pass_filter.h`

This is a simple implementation of a discrete low pass filter to filter noisy signals. A low pass filter will let low-frequency signals through and attenuate high-frequency signals (-3dB cutoff).

## `median_filter.h`

A simple median filter implementation. Used to smooth noisy signals.
